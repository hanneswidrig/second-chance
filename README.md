# Second Chance WordPress Plugin
### Created for the PennyTheme

The purpose of this plugin is to allow losers of an auction an opportunity buy the product their were attempting to win at penny auction. Currently set internally to the top 5 bidders who lost the auction, this could be adjusted in the future. The rate of discount is directly relative to the price of buying a bid from the site.

There are currently not any known bugs at this time.
